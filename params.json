{"body":"#### Introduction ####\r\n\r\nTextual is a highly modified version of the open source project known \r\nas LimeChat. Much of the app uses the open standard of WebKit which \r\nmakes customization easy through the use of CSS 3 and HTML 5. Plugins \r\nwritten in Objective-C and scripts made with AppleScript (and other \r\nlanguages) are also supported.\r\n\r\n#### License ####\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2010 — 2012 Codeux Software & respective contributors.\r\n       Please see Contributors.pdf and Acknowledgements.pdf\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\r\nare met:\r\n\r\n   * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n   * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n   * Neither the name of the Textual IRC Client & Codeux Software nor the\r\n     names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\r\n     derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS ``AS IS'' AND\r\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\r\nARE DISCLAIMED.
